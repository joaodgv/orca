# ORCA HUD
Orca is a new open source completely free Poker HUD. I started this project because there were no free poker huds available for mac. I believe poker HUDS should not be behind paywalls because in their simplest form they act as calculators.

## RoadMap
- [X] Create a parser for pokerstars
- [X] Get statistics from hand history
- [X] Create a database to hold the statistics
- [X] update statistics as the game is being played
- [X] Create Player class
- [X] Implement poker888 parser
- [X] Save player stats in DB
- [X] restore player stats from DB
- [X] adapt parser to not repeat hands
- [ ] Create simple GUI to view statistics
- [ ] Update code to work with more than 1 table

## State of the program
Right now orca is only available as a console application and is able to track PokerStars or 888poker statistics. It also only tracks 10 playing statistics but in the future it will also track BB/100 and ROI.
