# ORCA HUD
Orca is a new open source completely free Poker HUD. I started this project because there were no free poker huds available for mac. I believe poker HUDS should not be behind paywalls because in their simplest form they act as calculators.

## RoadMap

- [X] Get statistics from hand history
- [ ] Create a database to hold the statistics
- [ ] update statistics as the game is being played
- [ ] Create Player class
- [ ] Create simple GUI to view statistics
